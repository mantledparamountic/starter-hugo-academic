### For fun

{{% staticref "notes/Energy_flux_in_a_conducting_wire_more_formal.pdf" "newtab" %}}Here{{% /staticref %}} is a PDF document showing that the claim that "energy doesn't flow in wires" is false. This claim was popularized by several youtubers (some of them having high reach). A physical fact derived in the PDF I found interesting is that the wire cannot be in isothermal condition if its resistivity does not vanish and when there is a current going through it.</p>
